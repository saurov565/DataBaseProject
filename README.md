### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a **database design and implementation** for a **Tourism Management System**, created as part of the *Introduction to Database* course at AIUB. It aims to provide a **centralized database** to manage travel-related services such as **flight bookings, hotel reservations, accommodations, food services, transportation, and payments**.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Components

* **ER Diagram (Page 5)**: Shows entities like *Customer, Employee, Travel Agency, Hotel, Accommodation, Flight, Transportation, Food Booking, Payment* and their relationships.
* **Normalization (Pages 6â€“15)**: Step-by-step normalization up to 3NF for different entities, ensuring data consistency and eliminating redundancy.
* **Table Creation (Pages 18â€“27)**: SQL scripts to create relational tables such as *Agency Info, EMP Info, CUS Info, Airline, Hotel Info, Accommodation, Payment*.
* **Data Insertion (Pages 28â€“36)**: Sample records inserted into the tables to test the database.
* **Query Writing (Pages 37â€“41)**: SQL queries including single-row, multi-row, subqueries, joins, and views to retrieve meaningful information.
* **Conclusion (Page 43)**: Highlights how the project translates theoretical database concepts into practice and can serve as a schema for any travel management system.
  
### ðŸ“Œ Purpose & Benefits

* Provides an **efficient way to store, retrieve, and manage travel data**.
* Helps both **travel agencies and customers** by streamlining processes.
* Ensures **data integrity** through proper normalization and relational constraints.
* Acts as a **foundation for future database-driven applications** in tourism.

âœ… **In short**:
This work designs and implements a **fully functional database schema** for managing tourism services. It covers **database modeling (ERD), normalization, SQL table creation, sample data insertion, and queries**, making it a complete academic project on database systems.
